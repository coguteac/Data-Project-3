The hacker.ipynb file is a Jupyter Notebook containing the project that analyses two types of posts "Ask HN" and "Show HN" on Hacker News platform.
prerequisites: csv, datetime.
Conclusion: Ask posts receive more comments than show posts.
Further Analysis: As a further practice I wanted to print a distribution of the comments for Ask HN over the hour periods.
